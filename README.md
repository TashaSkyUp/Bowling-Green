# Bowling Green Campaign Site

This repository now contains a simple static React application built with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/). The app provides placeholder pages for a local campaign website.

## Development

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Build the static site:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

## Deployment

A GitHub Actions workflow builds the site and deploys the generated files in `dist/` to GitHub Pages whenever changes are pushed to `main`.

## Documentation

Planning documents from the original project are kept in the `docs/` directory.
